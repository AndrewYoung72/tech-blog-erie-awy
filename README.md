## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to build a functioning blog site where a user can signup and create blogs to be posted to a homepage. A logged in user should be able to create, update and delete there own blogs. A logged in user should also be able to add comments to existing blogs.
## Description
The application is not complete. The user is able to sign up, login, logout, and create a new blog which is posted to the homepage. When creating a blog the date created, username and blog title are diplayed at the top of the blog post. Inside of the blog content is a link that takes the user to a page where a comment can be added. However this does not function. All of the bogs are posted to the hompage because I cannot figure out how to load the users post to their dashboard. There is also no capability to update or delete their posts. If the user leaves the page or is idle for sometime the user is still logged in when returning to the page if the user does not use the logout function. 

## Lessons
This challenge made it clear to me how little I am learning. I've learned to copy and paste things I find and make modifications to get some things working. But I could not explain to you why they work. What little I do have funtioning on this challenge is due to help from my tutor. I've spent two weeks worth of my available study time searching on the internet for answers but they either don't apply to what I need or maybe they do and I just don't know what I am looking at. I hate leaving things incomplete but I can't waste anymore time on this challenge.
